# Installation and Setup
To set up the environment for this project:
# Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values
-  Normalizing/Standardizing features
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
# Code Structure
The codebase is structured as follows:
- data/: Contains raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- src/: Scripts for preprocessing
- results/: Outputs, evaluation metrics, and visualizations
# Future Work
Potential improvements and next steps include:
- Incorporating additional features or external datasets
- Experimenting with advanced modeling techniques
- Deploying the model into a production-ready application
